            A. Civil Services or for that matter any competitive exam tests the
            fundamentals more than anything else.
          </p>
          <p>
            B. NCERT develops subject understanding in a systematic way. On the
            way many facts and data are presented.

          <p>
            C. UPSC in its notification stresses a general understanding of the

            understood from past question papers.

            E. Learning through questions has been Indian way since vedic times
            as seen in Prashnopanishad. It reflects an interactive style where
            the student has worked out the question for himself before he is
            provided an answer.

          <p>
            F. We have compiled an exhaustive question bank of all the subjects

            I. The interactive style is captured in the software, with the scope
            to book mark questions for later review and deeper contemplation.
            The time spent on each question is captured, that will give inputs
            to modify the preparation strategy.

            J. Focus: With book marking of questions, the time required for
            revision can be compressed to manageable levels. Time saved is time
            earned.
